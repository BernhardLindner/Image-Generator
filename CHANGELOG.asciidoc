*Version 1.2*
Merged Christian FibichÂ´s link:SDL_Viewer[99_SDL_Viewer]

*Version 1.1*
Split OpenCL setup (creating context, building program, kernel) and
execution of the kernel (calculating the Mandelbrot set, generating the image)
into separate functions (setup_OpenCL() and generate_image()) to avoid
rebuilding the same OpenCL kernel after every image calculation and wasting
CPU time.

*Version 1.0*
Initial Release
